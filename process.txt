# Evermark Refactoring Process

## Current Status
We have successfully refactored the Farcaster mini-app to eliminate Supabase dependencies. The app now uses:
- Blockchain as the primary data source
- Local storage for caching and state persistence
- IPFS for metadata storage with local fallbacks
- Wallet-based authentication

## Phase 1: Error Testing & Fixing
**Goal**: Identify and resolve all runtime errors to ensure a stable application

### Testing Process
1. Systematically test all user flows:
   - Authentication (connect wallet, sign in)
   - Browsing Evermarks
   - Creating new Evermarks
   - Viewing Evermark details
   - Voting on Evermarks
   - Profile and staking functionality

2. Document all errors using the errorform.txt template
   - Focus on console errors
   - Categorize by severity and type
   - Identify patterns in errors

3. Implement fixes:
   - Add graceful fallbacks for blockchain operation failures
   - Implement better error handling throughout the app
   - Focus on UX during error states

### Key Areas to Test
- Contract interactions (reading and writing)
- IPFS uploads and retrievals
- Wallet connection edge cases
- Data loading states
- Cross-device compatibility

## Phase 2: Styling & UI Enhancement
**Goal**: Implement a cohesive library-themed UI with dark mode support

### Styling Process
1. Create core theme components:
   - Theme context and provider
   - Basic component library (cards, buttons, inputs)
   - Skeumorphic elements (books, shelves, paper textures)

2. Apply styling systematically:
   - Start with layout components
   - Style each page in sequence
   - Ensure consistent spacing and typography

3. Implement dark mode:
   - Create toggle component
   - Test all UI elements in both modes
   - Ensure proper contrast and readability

### UI Enhancement Areas
- Loading states and skeletons
- Error messaging
- Empty states
- Animations and transitions
- Improved typography and spacing

## Phase 3: Feature Enhancements
**Goal**: Add functionality that improves the user experience

1. Offline support improvements:
   - Better caching strategies
   - Offline indication
   - Queue operations for when network is available

2. Performance optimizations:
   - Lazy loading components
   - Virtualized lists for large data sets
   - Code splitting

3. User experience improvements:
   - Guided tutorials
   - Better first-time experience
   - Transaction status indicators

## Current Technical Debt
- Inconsistent error handling
- Limited blockchain indexing capabilities
- Potential performance issues with large collections
- Limited test coverage

## Success Criteria
- No console errors during normal operation
- Graceful degradation when services are unavailable
- Consistent styling across all components
- Dark mode toggle works correctly
- Mobile-friendly experience
